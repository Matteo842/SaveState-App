# SaveState - Android App (Concept / UI Test)

> ⚠️ **DISCLAIMER: WORK IN PROGRESS / PROTOTYPE**
> This repository currently serves **ONLY** as a UI/UX design playground. It is **NOT** a functional application yet.

## 📱 About This Project
This is an experimental repository exploring a potential Android companion/port for the main **SaveState** project.

Given the interest shown by the community, I am making this repository public to share the progress on the visual interface. However, please note that this is strictly a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** to test Material Design 3 implementation and layout ideas for game save management.

**Current Status:** `Pre-Alpha / UI Only`

## 🛑 Important Note for Users & Developers
**Please do NOT attempt to build, run, or install this application expecting functionality.**

* The code currently contains **no backend logic**.
* The build environment is set up for local UI testing only.
* Buttons and menus are visual placeholders.

**I strongly discourage cloning this repo to "try it out" at this stage.** You will likely encounter build errors or a non-responsive interface.

## 🎨 Current UI Goals
The aim is to create a clean, modern interface for managing emulator save states (Citra, Dolphin, DuckStation, Flycast, etc.).

* **Material Design 3:** Utilizing modern Android components.
* **Dark Mode:** Native dark theme support.
* **Emulator Cards:** Visual layout for different emulator profiles.

## 📅 Roadmap
There is **no estimated timeline (ETA)** for a functional release. Development is happening sporadically as a feasibility study.

Please stick to the main SaveState repository for the stable, working CLI tools.
